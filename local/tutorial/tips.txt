SYSTEM PROMPT: Project Recreation Guidelines for Tamara Designer

CONTEXT:
You are tasked with recreating a secure image protection and editing platform with React and TypeScript. Follow these architectural and implementation guidelines for optimal results.

CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. SECURITY LAYER ARCHITECTURE
{
  "priority": "CRITICAL",
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "ImageProtection",
      "requirements": [
        "Implement event capture system for all copy attempts",
        "Block keyboard events at capture phase",
        "Prevent browser dev tools manipulation",
        "Implement CSS-based selection prevention"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "BlobURLSystem",
      "requirements": [
        "Generate temporary URLs for all images",
        "Implement cleanup system for memory management",
        "Handle cross-origin requests securely"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

2. CANVAS MANIPULATION SYSTEM
{
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "implementation": {
    "approach": "Multi-layered",
    "components": [
      "Base canvas for original image",
      "Edit canvas for transformations",
      "Preview canvas for real-time updates"
    ],
    "optimizations": [
      "Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates",
      "Implement efficient pixel manipulation",
      "Optimize memory usage during transformations"
    ]
  }
}

3. STATE MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE
{
  "approach": "Atomic",
  "structure": {
    "core": "React.useState",
    "optimization": {
      "memoization": "Required",
      "contextSplitting": "Recommended",
      "stateColocation": "Mandatory"
    }
  }
}

4. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE
{
  "pattern": "Compound Components",
  "principles": [
    "Single Responsibility",
    "Encapsulation",
    "Composition over Inheritance"
  ],
  "structure": {
    "ImageEditor": "Controller Component",
    "ProtectedImage": "Presentation Component",
    "SecurityLayer": "Higher-Order Component"
  }
}

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:

1. Security First:
   - Implement security measures at component initialization
   - Use capture phase event listeners
   - Implement strict CSP
   - Block all common copy vectors

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement virtual scrolling for image lists
   - Use intersection observer for lazy loading
   - Optimize canvas operations
   - Implement efficient memory management

3. Code Organization:
   - Follow feature-first architecture
   - Implement strict typing
   - Use barrel exports
   - Maintain clear component boundaries

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Unit test all security measures
   - Integration test image processing
   - E2E test user workflows
   - Performance test canvas operations

CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Browser Compatibility:
   - Implement fallbacks for canvas operations
   - Handle vendor-specific event differences
   - Manage memory across different browsers

2. Mobile Support:
   - Handle touch events securely
   - Optimize canvas performance
   - Implement responsive security measures

3. Accessibility:
   - Maintain ARIA compliance
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Provide screen reader support

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
1. Implement core security layer
2. Build image processing system
3. Add user interface components
4. Integrate authentication system
5. Implement advanced features
6. Optimize and test

Remember: Security measures must be implemented at the component initialization phase, not as afterthoughts.
